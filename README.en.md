**EasyImageCopy** is a powerful Chrome browser extension designed to help users easily and precisely copy any image from web pages, especially those generated by dynamic content. It provides an intelligent element selection and monitoring mechanism, displaying a convenient floating copy button over target images for one-click copying to clipboard.

## ‚ú® Features

- **One-Click Floating Button**: Display a floating copy button next to specified image elements for intuitive operation.
- **Dynamic Content Awareness**: Uses `MutationObserver` to monitor page changes in real-time, ensuring the button always points to the latest image even when content is dynamically loaded or updated.
- **Precise Positioning**: Automatically calculates and adjusts button position to ensure it always appears at the top-right corner of target images without blocking content.
- **Asynchronous Copying**: Uses modern `Clipboard API` and `Fetch API` to asynchronously fetch and copy images without blocking the page.
- **Elegant UI Feedback**: Provides clear visual feedback for loading, success, and failure states to enhance user experience.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes comprehensive retry and anti-loop mechanisms to ensure stable operation even in complex Single Page Applications (SPAs).
